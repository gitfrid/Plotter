# Plotter
 C# Sample Code using Scottplot DataLogger and a ConcurrentQueue 

To plot values generated by a class library in real time on a PlotForm

The MainForm triggers the class library to enqueue lists with ten random Y-doubles into a ConcurrentQueue 
PlotForm dequeues the lists triggerd by a timer, and draws "almost real time" ten lines on a Scottplot DataLogger diagram. 

Is not fully real-time capable, and also slows down considerably above 10000 data points.

There are probably better ways to solve this, but should be sufficient for my purposes
