# Plotter
 C# Sample Code using Scottplot DataLogger and a ConcurrentQueue 

To exchange and plot the values which were generated by a Class Library in a PlotForm.

MainForm infinite enqueues list with ten random Y-doubles into a ConcurrentQueue 
PlotForm dequeues the list and draws infinite ten lines on a Scottplot DataLogger diagram 

Is not fully real-time capable, and also slows down considerably above 10000 data points
There are probably better ways to solve this, but should be sufficient for my purposes
